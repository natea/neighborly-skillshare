# Debugging Report: Application Startup Issues

**Date:** 2025-05-20
**Feature:** Application Layout & Configuration
**Files Investigated:** [`app/layout.tsx`](app/layout.tsx), [`next.config.js`](next.config.js)
**Reported by:** AI Debugger

## 1. Initial Issue: Geist Font Import Error in `app/layout.tsx`

### 1.1. Summary
A runtime error occurred in [`app/layout.tsx`](app/layout.tsx) at line 17, preventing the application from running. The error was a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'className')`. The build logs also indicated an `Attempted import error: 'Geist' is not exported from 'geist/font' (imported as 'Geist')`.

### 1.2. Root Cause Analysis
The core issue was an incorrect import and usage of the Geist font. The original code attempted to import a generic `Geist` object directly from the `geist/font` package and then access its `className` property. However, the `geist/font` library requires importing specific font objects (e.g., `GeistSans` from `geist/font/sans`).

### 1.3. Fix Applied to `app/layout.tsx`
1.  **Corrected Import Statement:**
    ```diff
    - import { Geist } from 'geist/font'
    + import { GeistSans } from 'geist/font/sans';
    ```
2.  **Updated className Usage:**
    ```diff
    -       <body className={Geist.className}>
    +       <body className={GeistSans.className}>
    ```

## 2. Subsequent Issue: Invalid `next.config.js` Option

### 2.1. Summary
After fixing the font import, a warning appeared during the `npm run dev` process:
`Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'serverActions' at "experimental"`
The message indicated that `experimental.serverActions` can be safely removed as Server Actions are available by default in Next.js 14.

### 2.2. Root Cause Analysis
The [`next.config.js`](next.config.js) file contained an `experimental` block with `serverActions: true`. This option is deprecated in Next.js 14.

### 2.3. Fix Applied to `next.config.js`
The `experimental` block related to `serverActions` was removed:
```diff
-  experimental: {
-    serverActions: true,
-  },
```

## 3. Verification
With both changes applied:
- The `TypeError` in [`app/layout.tsx`](app/layout.tsx) related to `Geist.className` is resolved.
- The import error for `Geist` is resolved.
- The warning regarding `experimental.serverActions` in [`next.config.js`](next.config.js) is resolved.
- The `npm run dev` command now starts the application successfully.

## 4. AI Verifiable Outcome Check
- [X] The runtime error "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'className')" in [`app/layout.tsx`](app/layout.tsx) is resolved.
- [X] The application's `npm run dev` command starts successfully without these errors.
- [X] This diagnosis and fix report is provided.
