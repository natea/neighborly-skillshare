# Debugging Report: Geist Font Import Error in app/layout.tsx

**Date:** 2025-05-20
**Feature:** Application Layout / Font Loading
**File Investigated:** [`app/layout.tsx`](app/layout.tsx)
**Reported by:** AI Debugger

## 1. Issue Summary

A runtime error occurred in [`app/layout.tsx`](app/layout.tsx) at line 17, preventing the application from running. The error was a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'className')`. The build logs also indicated an `Attempted import error: 'Geist' is not exported from 'geist/font' (imported as 'Geist')`.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

The core issue was an incorrect import and usage of the Geist font.
The original code attempted to import a generic `Geist` object directly from the `geist/font` package:
```typescript
import { Geist } from 'geist/font'
```
And then tried to use it as:
```typescript
<body className={Geist.className}>
```
However, the `geist/font` library does not export a generic `Geist` object in this manner. Instead, it provides specific font exports, such as `GeistSans` from `geist/font/sans` or `GeistMono` from `geist/font/mono`. The attempt to access `Geist.className` resulted in a TypeError because `Geist` was undefined due to the failed import.

## 3. Fix Applied

To resolve this issue, the following changes were made to [`app/layout.tsx`](app/layout.tsx):

1.  **Corrected Import Statement:** The import statement was modified to correctly import the `GeistSans` font object from its specific path within the `geist` package.
    ```diff
    - import { Geist } from 'geist/font'
    + import { GeistSans } from 'geist/font/sans';
    ```

2.  **Updated className Usage:** The `className` prop on the `<body>` tag was updated to use the correctly imported `GeistSans` object.
    ```diff
    -       <body className={Geist.className}>
    +       <body className={GeistSans.className}>
    ```

## 4. Verification

With these changes, the `GeistSans.className` will now correctly provide the necessary CSS class name for the Geist Sans font. The application should no longer encounter the `TypeError` related to `Geist.className` and the import error for `Geist` should be resolved.

The `npm run dev` command should now start successfully, and the application should render with the intended Geist Sans font applied to the body.
