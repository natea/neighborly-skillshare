# GitHub Template Research Report: Neighborly Skillshare MVP

**Date:** May 20, 2025
**Prepared by:** AI GitHub Template Scout
**Project:** Neighborly Skillshare

## 1. Introduction

This report details the research conducted to identify suitable GitHub project templates for the Neighborly Skillshare MVP. The goal was to find a template that could accelerate development by providing a solid foundation for the project's specific requirements, including its technology stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase) and core features (user management, skill listings, messaging, geolocation, reviews). This research was informed by key project documents, including the [Master Project Plan (`docs/master_project_plan.md`)](docs/master_project_plan.md), [High-Level Acceptance Tests (`docs/testing/high_level_acceptance_tests/`)](docs/testing/high_level_acceptance_tests/), [Product Requirements Document (`init_docs/product_requirements.md`)](init_docs/product_requirements.md), and others.

## 2. Research Methodology

### 2.1 Search Strategy

The primary research tool was the Perplexity AI deep research function, targeting templates and starter kits specifically built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase. The search focused on solutions that either explicitly mentioned community marketplace or social platform features or provided a strong base for implementing such features.

### 2.2 Keywords Used

The following query was used for the deep research:
"Best Next.js TypeScript Supabase starter templates for community marketplace or social platform features like user profiles, listings, and messaging"

### 2.3 Evaluation Criteria

Templates were evaluated against the following criteria derived from the Neighborly Skillshare project documentation:

*   **Technology Stack Alignment:**
    *   Must use Next.js (preferably App Router) and TypeScript.

    *   Modularity and clear separation of concerns.

## 3. Considered Templates (Based on Perplexity Research)

The Perplexity research highlighted several potentially relevant templates and concepts. The following were considered prime candidates for closer evaluation:

1.  **Supastarter (e.g., by Jon Meyers or similar comprehensive SaaS kits):** (Source 12 in Perplexity output). Often emphasizes DB schema migrations, TypeScript types generation, full Next.js App Router usage, and common SaaS features. Typically well-documented and structured.
2.  **Supaboost:** (Source 6) Described with Stripe Connect, MFA, File Management. More directly geared towards digital marketplaces, which has some overlap.
3.  **NextBase:** (Source 3) Features React Query and testing setup. Mentioned for social feed implementations, indicating good data handling.
4.  **Codekaito Social (Supabook):** (Sources 7, 18) A social media app example with posts, friends. Useful for seeing social feature implementation with Supabase.
5.  **Makerkit Lite / Next.js SaaS Starter by Makerkit:** (Source 13) Uses Turborepo, often a full-featured SaaS starter, good for understanding monorepo structure if needed, but potentially overly complex for this project's immediate needs.
6.  **Official Supabase Next.js Examples:** (Sources 1, 2, 4) Basic starters showing Next.js + Supabase integration, good for understanding fundamentals but lack higher-level application structure.

## 4. Comparative Analysis & Rationale

After reviewing the capabilities of the identified templates, **Supastarter** (referring to comprehensive Next.js/Supabase SaaS starter kits like the one often demonstrated by Jon Meyers or similar mature projects) emerges as the most promising candidate.

### 4.1 Detailed Analysis: Supastarter

*   **Technology Stack Alignment (High):** Supastarter templates are typically built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and offer deep Supabase integration. They often include pre-configured RLS, database migration examples (Supabase CLI), and Vercel deployment readiness.
*   **Core Feature Support (Medium to High Foundation):**
    *   **User Authentication & Profiles:** Excellent. Usually provides full auth flows (email/pass, social, magic links), profile pages, and account management using Supabase Auth. RLS for data protection is common.
    *   **Listings Management:** Low (Directly). No specific "skill listing" feature, but the underlying CRUD operations, database interaction patterns, and UI components for forms/data display provide a strong base to build this.
    *   **Messaging System:** Low to Medium (Foundation). Supabase Realtime might be set up for basic notifications, but a full chat UI and logic would be custom. However, the user system and DB structure make integration feasible.
    *   **Ratings & Reviews:** Low (Directly). This would be a custom feature, but the user and potential "exchange" data models can be extended to support it.
    *   **Geolocation Capabilities:** Low (Directly). PostGIS and map libraries would need manual integration, but the Next.js/Supabase structure doesn't hinder this.
*   **Architecture & Design (High):** Generally well-structured, using modern Next.js best practices (Server Components, API Routes/Server Actions). Often includes TailwindCSS and a component library (e.g., Shadcn UI), facilitating mobile-first design. Documentation quality varies but is often good for established starters.
*   **Community & Maintenance (Medium to High):** Popular starters have active communities and are regularly updated. Licensing is usually MIT.
*   **Customizability & Extensibility (High):** While comprehensive, they are designed to be customized. The clear structure helps in adding new modules or modifying existing ones.

### 4.2 Comparison with Other Candidates

*   **Supaboost:** While strong for marketplaces, its potential focus on *digital* products and specific payment integrations (Stripe Connect) might be less directly aligned than a more general SaaS starter that can be molded. However, its file management and MFA are pluses.
*   **NextBase / Codekaito Social:** These are more example applications than full starter kits. Useful for understanding specific features (social feeds, basic social interactions) but may lack the overall application structure, tooling, and polish of a dedicated starter like Supastarter.
*   **Makerkit:** Potentially too complex with its monorepo structure for the initial MVP unless the project anticipates needing a monorepo very early on.
*   **Official Supabase Examples:** Too minimal. They demonstrate basic integration but lack the application-level framework (routing, layouts, UI components, advanced auth flows) that Supastarter provides.

### 4.3 Rationale for Selecting Supastarter

Supastarter is chosen because it provides the most robust and closest-to-production-ready *foundation* for the common application shell requirements:
*   **User Management:** Saves significant time on implementing secure and complete authentication and profile management.
*   **Modern Stack & Best Practices:** Ensures the project starts with a current Next.js (App Router) setup, TypeScript, and proper Supabase integration patterns.
*   **Developer Experience:** Often includes good DX features like type generation, linting/formatting, and sometimes basic testing setups.
*   **Adaptability:** While SaaS-focused, the core elements (users, data handling, UI) are highly adaptable to a community marketplace model. The effort to add marketplace features is deemed less than building everything from a minimal starter, given the quality of the foundation.

It offers a higher starting point than basic examples and is more adaptable to Neighborly Skillshare's specific needs than a niche template focused on a different type of marketplace or a simple social clone.

## 5. Recommendation

It is **recommended to integrate a comprehensive Next.js/Supabase SaaS starter template like "Supastarter."** The specific Supastarter chosen should be one that is well-maintained, uses the Next.js App Router, and has good documentation for its Supabase integration.

**Confidence Level:** **75%**
This confidence level reflects that while the template provides a strong foundation (especially for user auth, profiles, and general app structure), significant custom development (estimated at 60-70% of feature work) will still be required for the unique marketplace, geolocation, messaging, and community aspects of Neighborly Skillshare.

**Estimated Benefit:**
*   Accelerates initial project setup, robust authentication, user profile system, basic UI structure, and Next.js/Supabase best-practice integration by an estimated **3-5 weeks** of development effort compared to starting from scratch or a very minimal template.
*   Provides a higher quality, more secure, and more maintainable starting point for common application functionalities.
*   Allows the development team to focus sooner on building the core value proposition: the hyperlocal skill exchange features.

**Required Alterations/Additions (High-Level for a Supastarter-like template):**

1.  **Database Schema Extension:**
    *   Design and implement tables for `skill_offers`, `skill_requests`, `exchanges`, `reviews`, `messages`, `user_locations` (with PostGIS for geospatial data).
    *   Establish relationships between these tables and the existing `users` (or `profiles`) table.
    *   Implement appropriate RLS policies for all new tables.
2.  **Skill Listings Feature:**
    *   Develop UI components (forms, cards, detail pages) for creating, displaying, editing, and managing skill offers and requests.
    *   Implement backend logic (API routes or Server Actions) for CRUD operations on listings.
    *   Integrate image/media uploads for listings using Supabase Storage.
3.  **Geolocation & Search:**
    *   Integrate a mapping library (e.g., Leaflet, React Map GL for Mapbox) for displaying locations and service areas.
    *   Implement frontend components for location input (e.g., address autocomplete, map-based area selection).
    *   Develop backend logic for geospatial queries using PostGIS (e.g., finding skills within a radius, searching by neighborhood).
    *   Enhance search functionality with keyword and category filters for listings.
4.  **Messaging System:**
    *   Design and build the UI for real-time chat (conversation list, chat window).
    *   Implement backend logic using Supabase Realtime for sending, receiving, and storing messages.
    *   Implement unread message indicators and notifications.
5.  **Ratings & Reviews System:**
    *   Develop UI components for submitting star ratings and textual reviews after a completed exchange.
    *   Implement backend logic for storing and retrieving reviews, linking them to users and exchanges.
    *   Display aggregated ratings and individual reviews on user profiles and potentially on skill listings.
6.  **Hyperlocal UI/UX Customization:**
    *   Tailor existing UI components (from Shadcn UI/TailwindCSS if included) and create new ones to reflect Neighborly Skillshare's branding and community-focused, friendly aesthetic.
    *   Ensure all user flows are intuitive and optimized for mobile-first usage.
7.  **Custom Business Logic:**
    *   Implement logic to handle different exchange types (paid, barter, free).
    *   Develop workflows for managing the lifecycle of an exchange (e.g., initiation, acceptance, completion, cancellation).
8.  **Content Moderation & Reporting (Basic):**
    *   Implement UI for reporting users or listings.
    *   Develop a basic backend mechanism to flag reported content/users for admin review.
9.  **Stripping/Adapting Unneeded SaaS Features:**
    *   Carefully review and remove or adapt any SaaS-specific features not relevant to Neighborly Skillshare (e.g., complex subscription management, multi-tenancy if overly broad, advanced team features). Focus on leveraging the core user and data management capabilities.
10. **Testing:**
    *   Write unit and integration tests for all new custom features.
    *   Adapt any existing test setup in the template for the new functionalities.

## 6. Conclusion

The integration of a comprehensive starter template like "Supastarter" offers a significant advantage by providing a robust, modern, and well-structured foundation for Neighborly Skillshare. While substantial custom development is required for the platform's unique hyperlocal marketplace features, the template accelerates the setup of essential boilerplate such as user authentication, profile management, and the overall Next.js/Supabase application architecture. This allows the development team to focus more quickly on delivering the core value proposition of the project. The 75% confidence level reflects a strong belief in the template's utility, balanced with an understanding of the customization effort ahead. The next step will be to create the Template Integration Guide.
