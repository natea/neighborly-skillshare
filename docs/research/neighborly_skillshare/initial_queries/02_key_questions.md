# Key Research Questions: Neighborly Skillshare

This document outlines the key questions that this strategic research aims to answer for the Neighborly Skillshare project. These questions are derived from the research objectives defined in the [`01_scope_definition.md`](docs/research/neighborly_skillshare/initial_queries/01_scope_definition.md) file and are informed by the [`init_docs/blueprint.md`](init_docs/blueprint.md).

## 1. Market Analysis

*   **Competitor Landscape:**
    *   What are the most prominent existing platforms (local, national, international) that facilitate skill/service exchange or local community interaction (e.g., Nextdoor, TaskRabbit, Facebook Groups, local forums, Craigslist, Thumbtack, Handy, Meetup)?
    *   What are the specific features, target audiences, and business models of these competitors?
    *   What are the perceived strengths and weaknesses of each major competitor from a user perspective (e.g., usability, trust, cost, range of services, community feel)?
*   **Market Gaps & Opportunities:**
    *   What unmet needs or frustrations do users experience with existing solutions for hyperlocal skill exchange?
    *   Are there specific niches or types of skill exchanges that are underserved by current platforms?
    *   What opportunities exist for Neighborly Skillshare to differentiate itself (e.g., stronger trust mechanisms, better hyperlocal focus, unique community-building features, simpler UI/UX)?
    *   How significant is the demand for a dedicated hyperlocal skill-sharing platform?

## 2. Target Audience Deep Dive

*   **User Demographics & Psychographics:**
    *   Who are the primary users (skill providers and skill seekers) in a typical neighborhood? (Consider age, tech-savviness, lifestyle, community involvement).
    *   What are their motivations for wanting to share skills or seek local help (e.g., income, saving money, convenience, meeting neighbors, learning new things, contributing to the community)?
    *   What are their key pain points or challenges when trying to find or offer skills locally currently? (e.g., lack of trust, difficulty finding reliable people, safety concerns, inconvenience).
*   **Needs & Expectations:**
    *   What features are considered "must-haves" for a platform like Neighborly Skillshare? (Referencing MVP features in blueprint: profiles, posting, search, messaging, ratings).
    *   What are their expectations regarding trust, safety, and privacy on such a platform?
    *   How important is ease of use and a mobile-first experience?
    *   What kind of community guidelines and moderation would make them feel safe and respected?
    *   What are their attitudes towards paid vs. free/barter exchanges?

## 3. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies

*   **Safety and Trust:**
    *   What are the primary safety and security concerns for users (both providers and seekers)?
    *   How can the platform effectively build and maintain trust among users (e.g., verification, robust review systems, clear dispute resolution)?
*   **Adoption and Engagement:**
    *   What are the potential barriers to user adoption in a new hyperlocal market?
    *   How can the platform encourage initial sign-ups and sustained engagement (critical mass of users and listings)?
*   **Moderation and Quality Control:**
    *   What types of misuse or low-quality interactions could occur, and how can they be prevented or managed?
    *   What level of moderation is expected by users without feeling overly restrictive?
*   **Competition:**
    *   How can Neighborly Skillshare effectively compete against established players or informal existing solutions (e.g., word-of-mouth, local social media groups)?
*   **Monetization (Future Consideration, but MVP impact):**
    *   If future monetization is planned, what are user attitudes towards potential models (e.g., commission, subscription, premium listings) and how might this impact MVP design or perception? (Blueprint mentions optional payment for exchanges).

## 4. Key Technology Considerations

*   **Scalability:**
    *   Given the hyperlocal focus, what are the scalability requirements for Next.js and Supabase as the user base grows within individual communities and potentially expands to new ones?
    *   How will the chosen stack handle increasing numbers of users, listings, messages, and real-time updates?
*   **Security:**
    *   What are the key security considerations for protecting user data (personal information, messages, location data, potential payment info) with Next.js and Supabase?
    *   What specific security features or best practices should be implemented from the outset?
*   **Usability & Performance:**
    *   How can Next.js and Supabase contribute to a fast, responsive, and intuitive user experience, especially on mobile devices (mobile-first design)?
    *   What are the performance implications of features like real-time notifications and geolocation-based search?
*   **Integration Points (as per blueprint):**
    *   What are the best practices and potential challenges for integrating with geolocation APIs (e.g., Mapbox, Google Maps)?
    *   How will Supabase's real-time capabilities be best leveraged for notifications?
    *   What are the considerations for potential future integrations like background checks and payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal)?

## 5. Success Metrics for MVP

*   **User Adoption & Growth:**
    *   What are realistic targets for the number of registered users within the first 3-6 months in a pilot neighborhood?
    *   What is a good ratio of skill offerers to skill requesters?
*   **Engagement & Activity:**
    *   What defines an "active user"?
    *   What is the target number of new skill listings (offers and requests) per week/month?
    *   What is the target number of successful skill exchanges or connections made through the platform?
    *   How frequently are users engaging with core features like messaging and search?
*   **User Satisfaction:**
    *   What level of user satisfaction should be targeted (e.g., measured through surveys, app store ratings if applicable later, feedback forms)?
    *   What is an acceptable churn rate for the MVP phase?
*   **Community Building:**
    *   Are there qualitative or quantitative ways to measure if the platform is fostering community bonds (e.g., repeat interactions between users, positive testimonials about community impact)?
