# Research Scope Definition: Neighborly Skillshare

## 1. Project Goal

The primary goal of the Neighborly Skillshare project is to create a hyperlocal platform that connects neighbors for the purpose of exchanging skills and services. The platform aims to foster stronger community bonds and encourage mutual support among residents.

## 2. Core Problem Addressed

Neighborly Skillshare seeks to address the difficulty individuals face in finding and offering skills/services within their immediate geographic vicinity. Current solutions often lack a truly hyperlocal focus, may not inspire sufficient trust, or present usability challenges. This platform intends to fill this gap by providing a trusted, user-friendly, and community-centric online space.

## 3. Research Objectives

This initial strategic research aims to provide foundational insights to inform the SPARC Specification phase, particularly the definition of high-level acceptance tests and the Master Project Plan. The key areas of investigation include:

*   **Market Analysis:**
    *   Identify existing similar platforms (direct and indirect competitors).
    *   Analyze their strengths, weaknesses, and market positioning.
    *   Identify gaps in the current market that Neighborly Skillshare can address.
    *   Explore opportunities for differentiation and unique value propositions.
*   **Target Audience Deep Dive:**
    *   Define and segment the primary target users (residents seeking to offer or request skills/services).
    *   Understand their specific needs, pain points, and frustrations with existing solutions or lack thereof.
    *   Identify key motivations for using a hyperlocal skill-sharing platform.
*   **Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Identify potential risks (e.g., safety concerns, low adoption, moderation challenges, competition).
    *   Propose preliminary mitigation strategies for these risks.
*   **Key Technology Considerations:**
    *   Evaluate technology choices (Next.js, Supabase as per blueprint) in terms of scalability, security, and usability for the platform's requirements.
    *   Identify any other critical technology components (e.g., geolocation, real-time messaging, payment gateways as mentioned in the blueprint).
*   **Success Metrics for MVP:**
    *   Define key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
    *   Align these metrics with the project's core goals of community building and skill exchange.

## 4. Boundaries and Exclusions (Initial Research Phase)

*   This research will focus on strategic insights for the MVP.
*   Deep technical implementation details beyond high-level considerations are out of scope for this initial phase.
*   Detailed financial modeling or marketing campaign planning is excluded.
*   Exploration of post-MVP features will be limited unless directly relevant to understanding MVP success or core market positioning.

## 5. Context from User Blueprint

The research will heavily draw upon the [`init_docs/blueprint.md`](init_docs/blueprint.md), which outlines:
*   The elevator pitch: "hyperlocal platform connecting neighbors to exchange skills and services, fostering stronger community bonds and mutual support."
*   Primary users: Neighborhood residents.
*   MVP features: User registration, skill posting (offers/requests), search/filter, messaging, ratings/reviews, geolocation.
*   Technical preferences: Next.js, Supabase, Vercel.
*   Inspirations: Nextdoor (community), TaskRabbit (service discovery).
*   Concerns: Avoiding issues seen on platforms like Craigslist (safety, verification).
