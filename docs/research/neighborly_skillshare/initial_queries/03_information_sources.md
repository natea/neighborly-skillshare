# Information Sources: Neighborly Skillshare

This document outlines potential information sources to address the key research questions detailed in [`02_key_questions.md`](docs/research/neighborly_skillshare/initial_queries/02_key_questions.md) for the Neighborly Skillshare project. The primary method for gathering information will be through AI-powered search tools, supplemented by analysis of the provided [`init_docs/blueprint.md`](init_docs/blueprint.md).

## 1. Primary Research (For Human Follow-up - Beyond AI Capability)

While AI research can cover much ground, direct user interaction would be invaluable. If feasible, the project team could consider:

*   **Surveys:**
    *   Distribute to residents in potential pilot neighborhoods to gauge interest, identify desired skills, understand pain points with current solutions, and assess willingness to use a new platform.
    *   Focus on demographics, tech comfort, current methods of skill exchange, and feature preferences.
*   **Interviews/Focus Groups:**
    *   Conduct in-depth discussions with a diverse group of potential users (both skill providers and seekers).
    *   Explore motivations, concerns (especially regarding trust and safety), and detailed feedback on the concept.
*   **Community Leader Consultations:**
    *   Engage with local community leaders or organizations to understand neighborhood dynamics and potential partnership opportunities.

## 2. Secondary Research (AI Search & Analysis)

This will be the primary focus of the AI-driven research.

*   **Competitor Websites & Public Materials:**
    *   Analyze websites of platforms like Nextdoor, TaskRabbit, Thumbtack, Handy, local Facebook Groups, Meetup, etc.
    *   Examine their feature sets, user interface/experience, pricing models, community guidelines, and terms of service.
    *   Look for blog posts, press releases, or case studies detailing their strategies or user demographics.
*   **App Store Reviews & Forum Discussions:**
    *   Analyze user reviews for competing apps on platforms like Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
    *   Search forums (e.g., Reddit communities like r/local, r/neighborhood, r/TaskRabbit, specific city/town subreddits) for discussions about skill sharing, local services, and experiences with existing platforms.
    *   Identify common praises, complaints, and unmet needs.
*   **Market Research Reports & Articles:**
    *   Search for publicly available market research reports or industry analyses on the gig economy, sharing economy, hyperlocal services, and community platforms.
    *   Look for statistics on market size, growth trends, and consumer behavior.
*   **Technology Blogs & Documentation:**
    *   For technology considerations:
        *   Review official documentation for Next.js, Supabase, Vercel.
        *   Search for articles and discussions on best practices, scalability, security, and performance related to these technologies.
        *   Explore information on integrating geolocation APIs (Mapbox, Google Maps), real-time services, and payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal).
*   **Academic Papers & Social Studies:**
    *   Search for studies on community building, social capital, trust in online interactions, and the impact of technology on local communities.
*   **News Articles & Publications:**
    *   Look for articles discussing trends in local economies, community initiatives, and challenges/successes of similar platforms.
