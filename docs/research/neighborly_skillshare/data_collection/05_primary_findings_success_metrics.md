## 7. Conclusion: Defining MVP Success

Based on the metrics outlined above, the MVP of Neighborly Skillshare can be considered successful if it achieves:

1. **Critical Mass in Pilot Areas:** Sufficient user density in initial neighborhoods to enable regular skill exchanges.

2. **Active Engagement:** High percentage of users actively posting skills, searching, and messaging.

3. **Completed Exchanges:** Demonstrated ability to facilitate actual skill exchanges between neighbors.

4. **Trust & Safety:** Positive trust indicators and low rates of safety issues.
