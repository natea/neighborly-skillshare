**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** May 20, 2025  
**Prepared by:** Pheromind AI Project Planning Team

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of This Document

This Master Project Plan (MPP) provides a comprehensive, phased approach to building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Neighborly Skillshare. It outlines specific tasks, deliverables, and AI-verifiable outcomes for each phase of development. This plan is designed to incrementally build the system toward passing the High-Level Acceptance Tests defined in the [`docs/testing/high_level_acceptance_tests/`](../testing/high_level_acceptance_tests/) directory.

### 1.2 Project Vision

Neighborly Skillshare is a hyperlocal platform connecting neighbors to exchange skills and services, fostering stronger community bonds and mutual support. The platform will enable users to offer and request skills, search based on location and categories, communicate securely, and build trust through ratings and reviews.

### 1.3 MVP Scope Summary

The MVP will include:
- User registration and profile management
- Skill posting (offers and requests)
- Geolocation-based search and discovery
- Secure in-app messaging
- User ratings and reviews
- Basic trust and safety mechanisms

Out of scope items are detailed in the [Product Requirements Document (Section 7.0)](../../init_docs/product_requirements.md).

### 1.4 Guiding Principles

1. **User-Centric Development:** Prioritize features that deliver the most value to users
2. **Incremental Delivery:** Build and test in small, verifiable increments
3. **Quality First:** Ensure each component meets quality standards before proceeding
4. **Trust & Safety:** Incorporate trust mechanisms from the beginning
5. **Mobile-First Design:** Optimize for mobile users while ensuring desktop compatibility
6. **Hyperlocal Focus:** Maintain emphasis on neighborhood-level connections

## 2. Project Phases Overview

The project will be executed in six distinct phases:

1. **Foundation & Setup:** Establish development environment, project architecture, and core infrastructure
2. **User Management System:** Implement user registration, authentication, and profile management
3. **Skill Exchange Marketplace:** Develop skill posting, management, and search functionality
4. **Communication System:** Build secure messaging and notification features
5. **Trust & Safety Features:** Implement ratings, reviews, and basic safety mechanisms
6. **Integration & Refinement:** Integrate all components, optimize performance, and prepare for launch

Each phase builds upon the previous one, with clear entry and exit criteria to ensure quality and completeness before proceeding.
