# Master Acceptance Test Plan: Neighborly Skillshare MVP

**Version:** 1.1 (Revised for Supastarter Template Integration)
**Date:** May 20, 2025
**Project:** Neighborly Skillshare
**Prepared by:** AI Test Plan Generator (Revised by AI Tester)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Master Acceptance Test Plan (MATP) outlines the strategy, scope, resources, and schedule for conducting high-level acceptance testing for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of "Neighborly Skillshare." The primary goal of this testing phase is to verify that the MVP meets the defined user requirements, business objectives, and quality standards, ensuring it is ready for launch. This plan is informed by the project's core documents, including the [`init_docs/blueprint.md`](../../init_docs/blueprint.md), [`init_docs/product_requirements.md`](../../init_docs/product_requirements.md), [`docs/research/initial_strategic_research_report.md`](../research/initial_strategic_research_report.md), the [`docs/research/high_level_test_strategy_report.md`](../research/high_level_test_strategy_report.md), the [`docs/research/github_template_research_report.md`](../research/github_template_research_report.md) (which recommends the Supastarter template), and the [`docs/template_integration_guide.md`](../template_integration_guide.md) (which details modifications to the Supastarter template).

### 1.2 Project Overview
Neighborly Skillshare is a hyperlocal platform designed to connect neighbors for the exchange of skills and services (paid, barter, or free), fostering stronger community bonds and mutual support. The MVP, built using the "Supastarter" Next.js/Supabase SaaS template as a foundation, will focus on core features enabling users to register, create profiles, post skill offers/requests, search locally, communicate securely, and provide ratings/reviews. The Supastarter template accelerates development of common functionalities like user authentication and profile basics, allowing focus on the unique marketplace features of Neighborly Skillshare.

## 2. Overall Testing Approach

The high-level acceptance testing approach will be user-centric, focusing on validating end-to-end user scenarios and core functionalities from an external perspective. The approach is guided by the principles outlined in the [`docs/research/high_level_test_strategy_report.md (Section 2)`](../research/high_level_test_strategy_report.md:18). The integration of the Supastarter template means that foundational elements like user authentication and basic profile management are leveraged from the template, but still require thorough E2E validation within the context of Neighborly Skillshare's specific user flows and custom extensions.

Key testing types will include:

*   **End-to-End (E2E) User Scenario Tests:** Simulating complete user journeys to validate overall user experience and system integration. These tests are designed to be AI-verifiable by checking for specific UI states, data changes, or system outputs. This includes testing the seamless integration of custom features with template-provided functionalities.
*   **Smoke Tests for Critical Paths:** A subset of E2E tests focusing on critical functionalities (including core auth flows provided by the template and essential custom features), run frequently to ensure core system stability. These will also have AI-verifiable completion criteria.
*   **Exploratory Testing:** Manual testing by team members to discover defects not easily caught by scripted tests, focusing on usability and edge cases, particularly around the integration points between template features and custom-built Neighborly Skillshare functionalities. While not directly AI-verifiable in execution, issues found will lead to new verifiable tests or bug reports.

All scripted tests (E2E and Smoke) will be documented with clear, AI-verifiable completion criteria, ensuring that test outcomes can be programmatically determined where feasible (e.g., checking for specific text on a page, database record existence, or API mock responses).

## 3. Scope of Testing

### 3.1 In Scope
The scope of acceptance testing for the MVP will cover all core features as defined in the [`init_docs/blueprint.md (Section 3.1)`](../../init_docs/blueprint.md:34) and [`init_docs/product_requirements.md (Sections 2.1 & 2.2)`](../../init_docs/product_requirements.md:74). This includes validating features provided by the Supastarter template (like authentication and basic profile structure) as they are utilized and extended by Neighborly Skillshare, as well as all custom-built features. The key application areas, as detailed in the [`docs/research/high_level_test_strategy_report.md (Section 3)`](../research/high_level_test_strategy_report.md:39), include:

*   User Registration and Profile Management (leveraging and extending Supastarter's auth and user management)
*   Skill Posting (Offers and Requests) (custom feature)
*   Geolocation-based Search and Discovery (custom feature with potential UI elements from template)
*   Secure In-App Messaging (custom feature, Supabase Realtime integration)
*   User Ratings and Reviews (custom feature)
*   Trust and Safety Mechanisms (basic verification, reporting, blocking) (custom logic with template's user context)
*   Core API Integrations (Geolocation, Real-time Notifications) as they manifest in user-facing features.

### 3.2 Out of Scope for MVP Acceptance Testing
The following are out of scope for MVP acceptance testing, aligning with the [`init_docs/product_requirements.md (Section 7.0)`](../../init_docs/product_requirements.md:589):

*   Native Mobile Applications (iOS, Android)
*   Full Offline Functionality
*   Advanced Verification Systems (background checks, ID verification)
*   Direct Payment Processing Integration
*   Group or Team Features (unless basic aspects are provided by Supastarter and minimally used)
*   Advanced Content Creation Tools
*   Integration with External Platforms (beyond core API needs like maps)
*   Automated AI-powered Matching
*   Multi-language Support (MVP is English-only)
*   Detailed User Analytics Dashboards
*   Performance, load, and stress testing beyond basic responsiveness checks during E2E scenarios.
*   Detailed API-level testing (which is a separate activity from user-facing acceptance tests).
*   Testing of Supastarter features that are explicitly stripped or not utilized by Neighborly Skillshare (as per [`docs/template_integration_guide.md`](../template_integration_guide.md)).

## 4. Test Environment Setup Considerations

*   **Environment:** A stable, dedicated test environment (Staging or Pre-Production) that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible is required. This environment will host the Next.js frontend (based on Supastarter) and connect to a Supabase instance configured for testing.
*   **Technology Stack:** The environment must support Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase.
*   **Data:** The test environment should be populated with realistic test data (see Section 5) and allow for easy data reset/refresh. This includes data for both template-provided user structures and custom Neighborly Skillshare entities.
*   **Access:** Testers and relevant stakeholders will require appropriate access to the test environment and any necessary tools (e.g., browser developer tools, Supabase Studio for verification if needed).
*   **Third-Party Services:** If using live third-party APIs (e.g., for geolocation), ensure that test accounts or sandboxed versions are used to avoid impacting production services or incurring unexpected costs. Mocking these services for automated tests is preferred for stability and cost-control.

## 5. Test Data Strategy Summary

A robust test data strategy is critical for effective acceptance testing. This strategy is detailed in the [`docs/research/high_level_test_strategy_report.md (Section 6)`](../research/high_level_test_strategy_report.md:127) and summarized here, with considerations for the Supastarter template:

*   **User Personas:** Utilize predefined user personas (Maya, Robert, Sophia, James from PRD) to create diverse test accounts. These accounts will leverage Supastarter's authentication and user table structure, extended with Neighborly Skillshare's specific profile fields.
*   **Skill Listings:** Generate realistic skill offers and requests (custom entities) across categories, exchange types (paid, barter, free), and with varied details.
*   **Geolocation Data:** Employ mock location data or tools to simulate users in different geographical locations to test search, radius, and proximity features.
*   **API Integration Data:** Prepare test addresses/coordinates for geolocation. For real-time notifications, set up users to trigger and receive various notification types.
*   **Trust and Safety Data:** Create profiles and content designed to test reporting, blocking, and review mechanisms (custom features).
*   **Data Integrity and Reusability:** Establish a baseline set of test data that can be easily reset. Document test data sets. Use anonymized or synthetic data where PII is involved. AI-verifiable tests will often rely on predictable test data inputs to check for expected outputs.
