# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Neighborly Skillshare

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** May 20, 2025  
**Prepared by:** Product Management Team

---

## 1.0 Introduction & Vision

### 1.1 Project Overview

Neighborly Skillshare is a hyperlocal platform designed to connect neighbors for the exchange of skills and services, fostering stronger community bonds and mutual support. The platform serves as a friendly neighborhood skills marketplace, built with a focus on trust and ease of use. Unlike existing platforms that often lack hyperlocal focus, strong trust mechanisms, or user-friendly interfaces, Neighborly Skillshare creates a safe, transparent, and accessible space specifically designed for local skill sharing.

The platform will enable users to offer their skills to neighbors, find trusted individuals offering needed services, and build stronger community relationships through these exchanges. By focusing on hyperlocal connections, Neighborly Skillshare aims to fill the gap between purely transactional service marketplaces and unstructured community forums.

### 1.2 Goals & Objectives

**Primary Goals:**

1. Create a trusted, hyperlocal platform that facilitates skill and service exchange between neighbors
2. Foster stronger community bonds and mutual support networks within neighborhoods
3. Provide a user-friendly, accessible alternative to existing platforms that lack either trust mechanisms or community focus
4. Support various exchange types (paid, barter, free) to accommodate diverse community needs
5. Prioritize user safety and privacy while maintaining ease of use

**Success Objectives:**

1. Achieve critical mass of users in pilot neighborhoods (5-10% of addressable population)
2. Facilitate regular skill exchanges with high completion rates (30%+ of requests resulting in completed exchanges)
3. Establish strong trust indicators (75%+ profile completion, 60%+ rating participation)
4. Maintain high user satisfaction (NPS >30, satisfaction score 4+ on 5-point scale)
5. Create measurable community impact through repeated interactions (30%+ of users engaging in multiple exchanges)
