## Concept

Connect with your neighbors and share skills!  Our hyperlocal community skill exchange platform helps you find and offer help within your neighborhood, building stronger community ties and fostering a spirit of mutual support.  Think of it as your friendly neighborhood skills marketplace, built for trust and ease of use.


## Problem

Many people possess valuable skills—tutoring, carpentry, gardening, baking—that could benefit their neighbors. However, connecting those willing to share their skills with those needing them is challenging.  Existing platforms are often too large, lack local focus, and may not prioritize community safety and trust.  This leaves a gap for a trustworthy, hyperlocal solution.


## Goal

Our primary goal is to create a thriving, trustworthy, and easy-to-use platform that connects neighbors within a specific geographic area (neighborhood or small town). This will facilitate the exchange of skills and services, fostering stronger community bonds, promoting local economic activity, and providing convenient access to needed assistance. We aim to build a platform where users feel safe, respected, and empowered to share their talents.


## Solution

We propose a mobile-first web application designed for intuitive navigation and ease of use. Key features include:

* **User Profiles:**  Detailed profiles showcasing offered and needed skills, enhancing transparency and building trust.  Profiles will include robust rating systems to facilitate community feedback.
* **Skill-Based Matching:** Users can easily search and filter for skills based on location and specific needs.
* **Secure Messaging:**  In-app messaging ensures safe and convenient communication between users.
* **Rating and Review System:**  A robust rating system allows users to provide feedback and build trust within the community.
* **Optional Background Checks:**  Integration with background check services (subject to user consent and local regulations) will provide an additional layer of safety and security.
* **Geolocation:**  Accurate geolocation via APIs (e.g., Mapbox or Google Maps) ensures users only connect with their immediate neighbors.
* **Real-time Notifications:**  Real-time notifications (e.g., using Supabase's real-time features) keep users informed of new requests, messages, and updates.

Our monetization strategy will focus on optional premium features such as enhanced profile verification and promoted listings, as well as a small commission on optional paid exchanges, ensuring the platform remains accessible and community-focused.  We will prioritize a friendly, community-focused design to build trust and encourage active participation.  Our suggested tech stack (Next.js and Supabase) offers scalability and robust features to support a growing community.
