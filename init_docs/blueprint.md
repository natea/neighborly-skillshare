**Project Title:** Neighborly Skillshare

**Prepared By:** Pheromind AI Onboarding Wizard

**Date:** May 20, 2025

**Section 1: The Big Picture - What is this program all about?**

1.  **Elevator Pitch:**  Neighborly Skillshare is a hyperlocal platform connecting neighbors to exchange skills and services, fostering stronger community bonds and mutual support.  Think of it as your friendly neighborhood skills marketplace, built for trust and ease of use.

2.  **Problem Solver:**  Neighborly Skillshare addresses the challenge of connecting people with valuable skills to those in their immediate community needing help. Existing platforms often lack a hyperlocal focus, trust mechanisms, and ease of use.

3.  **Why Does This Need to Exist?**  Existing platforms are often too broad, impersonal, and lack the community-building aspect critical for fostering trust and mutual aid within a neighborhood.  Neighborly Skillshare fills this gap by creating a safe, transparent, and user-friendly space for local skill sharing.

**Section 2: The Users - Who is this program for?**

1.  **Primary Users:** Residents of neighborhoods or small towns seeking to offer or request assistance with various skills and services.  This includes individuals of all ages and backgrounds.

2.  **User Goals:** 
    *   1. Find trustworthy individuals offering services needed in their neighborhood (e.g., tutoring, pet sitting, minor home repairs).
    *   2. Offer their skills to their neighbors, earning income or building community connections.
    *   3.  Build stronger relationships within their community through mutual support and assistance.

**Section 3: The Features - What can the program do?**

1.  **Core Actions (MVP):** 
    *   User registration and profile creation (including skill listings: offered and needed).
    *   Posting skill offers and requests (with detailed descriptions, pricing if applicable, availability, etc.).
    *   Searching and filtering for skills based on location, skill category, and keywords.
    *   Secure in-app messaging between users.
    *   Rating and reviewing other users.
    *   Viewing user profiles (including ratings, reviews, and offered/needed skills).
    *   Geolocation-based search to display nearby users and services.
    *   Real-time notifications for new messages and requests.

2.  **Key Feature Deep Dive (Example: Posting a Skill Offer):** A user can create a new skill offer by specifying the skill (e.g., "Baking Custom Cakes"), a detailed description (including ingredients used, customization options, etc.), pricing (if any), availability (e.g., weekdays evenings, weekends), and preferred service area (radius around their location).  They can also upload photos or videos showcasing their skills and past work.  The system will automatically use geolocation to define their service area unless they manually adjust it.

**Section 4: The Information - What does it need to handle?**

1.  **Information Needed:** 
    *   User profiles (name, contact info, location, skills offered/needed, ratings, reviews, profile picture).
    *   Skill offers and requests (title, description, location, pricing, availability, photos/videos).
    *   Messages between users.
    *   Ratings and reviews.
    *   Geolocation data (with user consent).
    *   Payment information (optional, for paid exchanges).

2.  **Data Relationships (Optional but helpful):**  Users have many skill offers and requests. Skill offers and requests are associated with users.  Users can send and receive messages, and give and receive ratings and reviews from other users.

**Section 5: The Look & Feel - How should it generally seem?**

1.  **Overall Style:** Clean, friendly, and trustworthy.  The design should evoke a sense of community and mutual support, avoiding overly commercial or corporate aesthetics.  A warm color palette, clear typography, and intuitive icons will be important.

2.  **Similar Programs (Appearance):**  Consider the visual styles of Nextdoor (for community focus) and task rabbit (for ease of service discovery).  However, we want to steer clear of designs that feel cluttered or overly technical.

---

**Section 6: The Platform - Where will it be used?**

1.  **Primary Environment:** Web application (mobile-first design).  Secondary consideration would be native iOS and Android apps (future development).

2.  **(If Mobile App):** No, offline functionality is not required for the MVP.


---

**Section 7: The Rules & Boundaries - What are the non-negotiables?**

1.  **Must-Have Rules:**  Robust moderation system to prevent scams, harassment, and inappropriate content. Clear community guidelines on acceptable behavior and service offerings.  Strong user privacy policy.  Compliant with all relevant data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).

2.  **Things to Avoid:**  Anything that compromises user safety or privacy.  Overly complex user interfaces.  Features that detract from the community-building aspect of the platform.

---

**Section 8: Success Criteria - How do we know it's perfect?**

1.  **Definition of Done (MVP Scenarios):** 
    *   1.  Successful launch of the web application with all core features working as expected.
    *   2.  Achievement of a minimum number of registered users and active skill listings/requests within a specified timeframe.
    *   3.  Positive user feedback and ratings.

---

**Section 9: Inspirations & Comparisons - Learning from others**

1.  **Similar Programs (Functionality):**  Nextdoor (community focus), TaskRabbit (service marketplace), Meetup (event organization), and Craigslist (classifieds - though we want to avoid its downsides).

2.  **Likes & Dislikes:** 
    *   Likes:  Nextdoor's strong community focus, TaskRabbit's ease of service discovery, Meetup's organized events.
    *   Dislikes:  Craigslist's lack of safety and verification, potential for scams in less-regulated platforms.

**Section 10: Future Dreams (Optional) - Where could this go?**

1.  **Nice-to-Haves (Post-MVP):**  Integration with local businesses for sponsored listings or partnerships.  Advanced search and filtering options.  Expansion to include other types of community assistance (e.g., borrowing tools).  Enhanced profile verification options (background checks).

2.  **Long-Term Vision:**  Becoming the leading hyperlocal platform for skill sharing and community building, expanding to multiple regions and providing valuable support for local economies.

**Section 11: Technical Preferences (Strictly Optional!)**

1.  **Specific Programming Language?** 
    *   Language: JavaScript/TypeScript (with Next.js)
    *   Reason: Next.js provides a robust framework for modern web applications, enabling server-side rendering, static site generation, and a great developer experience. TypeScript adds static typing for better code quality and maintainability.  Its SEO benefits and fast loading times are also highly desirable for this community-focused application.

2.  **Specific Database?** 
    *   Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
    *   Reason: Supabase offers a comprehensive backend-as-a-service solution including a PostgreSQL database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, and storage, which aligns well with the project's needs for user profiles, messaging, and real-time updates. Its ease of use can accelerate development and reduce operational overhead.

3.  **Specific Cloud Provider?** 
    *   Provider: Supabase (self-hosted or their cloud), Vercel (for Next.js deployment).  Other options could include AWS or Google Cloud.
    *   Reason: Flexibility. Supabase provides serverless functions, real-time databases, storage, and auth. Vercel is a strong choice for deploying Next.js applications because of its performance and developer tools.

Other Technical Considerations:
*   **Geolocation API:** Mapbox or Google Maps API for local search and displaying user locations (with consent).  Consider privacy implications and user control over location sharing.
*   **Real-time Notifications:** Leverage Supabase's real-time capabilities (PostgreSQL changes) for in-app messaging and updates.
*   **Background Check Integration:** API integration with a reputable background check service provider, ensuring compliance with all legal requirements and respecting user privacy.  This should be an optional feature, clearly communicated to users.
*   **Payment Gateway Integration:**  Stripe or PayPal for handling optional paid transactions.  Clearly communicate fees and payment methods to users.
